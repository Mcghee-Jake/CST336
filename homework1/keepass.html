            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people use simple memorable passwords for their digital accounts.
            A lot of people's passwords are just a few words that represent something to them with a numbers appended to the end or a few numbers or symbols substituted for letters.
            These passwords are very vulnerable to attack because password attacks are typically done by sofisticated software, not simple guessing.
            If that description sounds like the passwords you have been using, try
            <a class="link" href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/" target="_blank">this tool</a> 
            to give you and idea just how quickly a computer could break into your account if it were targetted.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create a really strong password, I recommend creating a pass phrase. 
            A passphrase is a sequence of 6 or more random words.
            For really sensitive passwords, such as your master password (more on this later) and e-mail I recommend using the
            <a class="link" href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice" target="_blank">diceware method</a> 
            to come up with a passphrase of 7 or more words.
            Some services requires you to use numbers and/or symbols within your password, or limit the length of the password you are allowed to use 
            in this situation you should use a password generator to create a random (or as close to random as computers can get) sequence of characters.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, most people only use a few different variations same password for all of their digital accounts.
            Although this makes it easer to remember your passwords, this is really poor security practice because it makes it so that if an attacker breaks into one of your accounts, they will very easily be able to break into the rest of them.
            Ideally you should have a unique password for each digital account you have.
            But how can you possibly remember all of your passwords if you need a seperate one for each digital account?
            The solution is a password manager.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Password managers store all of your usernames and password information inside of an encrypted file, which can only be unlocked with a master password.
            Using a password manager, it isn't necessary to memorize the login information for all of your accounts.
            You simply need to memorize your masster password (you can also physically write it down and store it somewhere secure until you memorize it)
            and then unlock your password generator each time you log into one of your accounts.
            
            <br /><br />
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KeePasss and is a free open source password manager that I recommend.
            While the original KeePass is only available for Windows, KeePassXC, which uses the same back end as KeePass, is available on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
            Additionally there are third party ports built for mobile phones, such as KeePass2Android (for Android) and MiniKeePass (for iOS) that allow use your KeePass database on the go.
            Admittedly, using a password manager isn't as easy to use as memorizing a few similar weak passwords and using them everywhere.
            However once you get used to it using a password manager isn't as bad as it might seem initially and it is certainly worth the additional effort to make your passwords far less vulnerable to attack.
