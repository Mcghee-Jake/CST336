        <main>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more we rely on technology in our daily lives the more vulnerable our private infromation becomes to the outside world.
            For this reason it has become increasinly important for everyone who uses technology to learn how to also protect and maintain their privacy in the digital world.
            This site is far from exhaustive or authoritative guide for mainting digital security. 
            However, for people who are new or unfarmiliar with digital security, I hope to offer you a few free and easy to use tools that I have found essential to maintaining my digital privacy.
            Though of these tools can offer you complete protection against outside attacks and surveillence (no software exist that can offer you complete protection), 
            I am confident that by learning to use these few simple tools you can dramitically improve your digital privacy and security.
