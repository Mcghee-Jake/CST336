        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signal is an application that provides secure end-to-end encrypted communication including text, picture, audio, video, and group messages.
        End-to-end encrpyted communication means that your messages are encrpyted locally before they are sent and decrypted locally when your message is recieved on the other end.
        This makes it significantly harder for any third party to eavesdrop on your conversations.
        Signal is most popular for its Android and iOS applications but is also available for desktop use on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
        Though Signal can send also send regular unencrypted SMS messages if only one party has the application installed, both parties must have Signal installed on their respective platform in order for its end-to-end encrpytion to work.
